# Weekly Programmer - Week 2

## Description
The sum of the primes below 10 is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`.

What is the sum of the primes less than ten million?

## Challenge Description
Your challenge today is to write a program that computes all the primes less than ten million and produce the sum of those primes. 

Calculating what numbers are prime is quite tricky, but a sufficiently clever algorithm should be able to produce the answer required for this challenge in ten seconds or less.

## Bonus Challenge
1) Finding the primes less than ten million in less than ten seconds is impressive. Can you find the primes less than a hundred million in less than twenty? What about a billion? How far can you go before your algorithm fails to complete the challenge in less than a minute?

2) Finding lists of primes online is easy, can you write a program to consume such a list and produce on demand the sum of all primes under `n`? (where `n` is within the range of the list used)

## Expected Output
The expected sum is: `3203324994356`
